# 🔠 LetterLinkTiles

An **on-chain Scrabble-inspired game** built on Flow.  
Players start with 7 randomly generated tiles and earn points by forming valid words. Additional tiles can be purchased using Flow tokens.

🧠 Word validation is powered by an AI agent.  
🎲 Tile randomness is verifiable, using Cadence Arch and Flow's native VRF.
